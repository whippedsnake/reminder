# A reminder to rest your eyes

A simple program that reminds you to look away from the screen every hour while it is on. 

## How it works

* Press Enter in CLI to start. The program will then remind you to look away from the screen. 
* Press q to quit. It stops the program completely.

## TODO

* Research the state and decide what will control it - the user input or time.
* Maybe make a Pomodoro timer out of this - waaay later?
